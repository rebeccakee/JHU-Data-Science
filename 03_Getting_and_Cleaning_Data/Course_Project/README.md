*Getting and Cleaning Data* Course Project
------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project was to prepare tidy data that can be used
for later analysis. The original, raw data represents data collected
from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full
description is available at this
[site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
where the data was obtained:

This directory contains the following files:

-   `README.md`, the current file, which describes the purpose of this
    project, the contents of this directory, and how they are
    connected.  
-   `CodeBook.md`, which describes in detail the dataset, its variables,
    and the transformations applied to it to produce a tidy dataset that
    is analysis-ready.  
-   `run_analysis.R`, the R script that was used to create the tidy data
    set.  
-   `tidy_data.txt`, which is the tidy dataset produced from the R
    script.

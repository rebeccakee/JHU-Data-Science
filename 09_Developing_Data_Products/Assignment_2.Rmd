## Introduction
This is the Week 3 Assignment of the Developing Data Products course on Coursera. In this assignment, we will create an interactive plot using `plotly`, using the `sleep` data. 

## Code for creating plot
```{r, warning=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(plotly))
data(sleep)
p <- plot_ly(sleep, x = ~group, 
                  y = ~extra, 
                  type = "box", 
                  color = ~group) %>% 
    layout(xaxis = list(title = "Type of drug received"), 
           yaxis = list(title = "Hours of sleep"),
           showlegend = FALSE)  %>%
    add_markers()
```

## Effect of drug type on hours of sleep
`r p`

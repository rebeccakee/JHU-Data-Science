## Introduction
This is the Week 2 Assignment of the Developing Data Products course on Coursera. In this assignment, we will create an interactive map using `leaflet`.

## Map of some popular tourist attractions in Singapore
```{r}
library(leaflet)
coords <- data.frame(lat = c(1.2834, 1.2816, 1.2540, 1.3138, 1.2868, 1.2863),
                     lng = c(103.8608, 103.8636, 103.8238, 103.8159, 103.8545, 103.8593))
popup <- c("Marina Bay Sands", "Gardens by the Bay", "Universal Studios Singapore", "Singapore Botanic Gardens", "Merlion", "ArtScience Museum")                  

coords %>% 
    leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(popup = popup)
```
